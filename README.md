Natural Language Processing 1
This is the first Natural Language Processing I'm creating. Basically, I'm working on the tweet classification. In order to detect if a particular tweet is harmful or not. The harmful tweet was classified as a disaster while the harmless as a nondisaster tweet. The Data used in this analysis was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
